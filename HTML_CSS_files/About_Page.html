                    Our custom databases gives you access to sequencing data from sequences of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 .
                    Our virus database has information on accession numbers, virus strain ID and country of origin for each sequencne. We have also
                    included data on the collection date for each sequence in our database and whether the strain contains a specific variant or not, this information can all be accessed from our Databases page.
                    We also have a protein database with information on protein structures of SARS-CoV-2.

                    Our Protein Viewer page contains 7 3D structures of proteins according to the reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2 .
                    These 3D structures are interactive giving you complete control over selecting different features, colouring residues of interest and other 
                    details you may be interested in. Each one has it's own link taking you directly to the page with the relavent sequence information. Other visualisations include
                    that of the Spike glycoprotein 6VYB which can be accessed from the D614G Variant page.

                    Their is a plethora of information avaliable on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 which is the disease that the virus causes. Our job is to give you insight 
                    into what the latest findings are and allow you to explore these for yourself in an interactive manner. This is a novel coronavirus that 
                    we haven't encountered before, there are always new findings and breakthroughs which help us understand this complex virus further, therefore it is 
                    important for everyone to understand what this virus is and the underlying science behind it.
