        <h2>Why Data and Statistics can help us track the Virus?<h2>
        <p>
        In the surveillance of the coronavirus disease, data and statistics provide important information on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infecting individuals across the globe with coronavirus (COVID-19).
        Using real-time data to track new cases on a daily bases helps us to understand the extent to which the virus is spreading, not only across whole countries but within different regions and areas 
        of cities,towns and local communities. All this information amongst many other factors helps make informed decisions such as lockdown restrictions being eased. Providing up-to-date data on a 
        regular basis is very important not only for the scientists and statisticians amongst us, but for all memebers of the general public. This ensures everyone is kept up to date with what's going 
        on, not only in their country of residence but across the whole world. Trends are very important, over recent weeks and months there has been a lot of talk about flattening the curve, this has been 
        discussed by many researchers and scientists working closely on the coronavirus pandemic as a way of containing the pandemic. Flattening the curve is all about slowing the spread of the virus so 
        that there's not a large influx of people who need to seek treatment all at once thus overwhelming the healthcare systems. This is not only to stop the spread of coronavirus but also so that people 
        with other illnesses and health issues can get treated alongside those infected with coronavirus. There are many diagrams with detailed explanations discussing the flattening 
        the curve startegy and how individual countries have performed in regards to containing the virus. The interactive visualisation above provides data on a real-time scale, updating itself every day. You can 
        track total cases recorded across the globe, you can also zoom in on the map to look at cases across a continent and by dragging the timeline you can see how the virus has been transmitting over time.
        Highlighting the key at the bottom shows which countries have been affected the most with the highest quantity of cases. As well as the map functionality, you can 
        make direct comparisons between different countries and set the timeline to dates you want to visualise data for. This can be done in both linear and logarithmic format.
